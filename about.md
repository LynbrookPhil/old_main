Lynbrook Philosophy Club is a club where you will learn about different philosophers and their philosophies. There's no one true way to see the world, so we're here to show you different ways and let you make that decision yourself. By analyzing real events through the lens of different philosophies we can get a deeper understanding of both the philosophies, and the world we live in.
